    "2) Median: \n",
    "The median is less affected by outliers. In this case, the median age would be the middle value, which is 33. The outlier doesn't influence the median as much as it does the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Mode:\n",
    "The mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, remains unaffected by the outlier in this example. There is no significant impact on the mode, as none of the ages repeat more than once.\n",

    "\n",
    "4) Range:\n",
    "The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, is significantly affected by outliers. In this case, the range would be 55 - 25 = 30. The outlier contributes to the larger range.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Variance and Standard Deviation: \n",
    "Both variance and standard deviation are sensitive to outliers. These measures quantify the spread of data around the mean. The presence of an outlier with a large deviation from the mean can lead to an inflated variance and standard deviation. This can potentially result in the spread of data being misinterpreted."
